# Add Popup Annotation

A Pop-up Annotation  displays text in a pop-up window for entry and editing. It shall not appear alone but is associated with a markup annotation, its parent annotation, and shall be used for editing the parent’s text. 
It shall have no appearance stream or associated actions of its own and shall be identified by the Popup entry in the parent’s annotation dictionary.

The following code snippet shows you how to add Popup Annotation in a PDF page.
