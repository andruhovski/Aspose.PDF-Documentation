This topic shows how to split PDF pages into individual PDF files in your .NET applications. To split PDF pages into single page PDF files using C#, the following steps can be followed:

1. Loop through the pages of PDF document through the [Document](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/pdf/aspose.pdf/document) objectâ€™s [PageCollection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/pdf/aspose.pdf/pagecollection) collection
1. For each iteration, create a new Document object and add the individual [Page](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/pdf/aspose.pdf/page) object into the empty document
1. Save the new PDF using [Save](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/pdf/aspose.pdf.document/save/methods/4) method

The following C# code snippet shows you how to split PDF pages into individual PDF files.
```cshrap
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_Pages();
            
// Open document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "SplitToPages.pdf");

int pageCount = 1;

// Loop through all the pages
foreach (Page pdfPage in pdfDocument.Pages)
{
    Document newDocument = new Document();
    newDocument.Pages.Add(pdfPage);
    newDocument.Save(dataDir + "page_" + pageCount + "_out" + ".pdf");
    pageCount++;
}
```
