To convert PDF files to TeX, Aspose.PDF has the class [LaTeXSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/pdf/net/aspose.pdf/latexsaveoptions) which provides the property OutDirectoryPath for saving temporary images during the conversion process.

The following code snippet shows the process of converting PDF files into the TEX format.

```cshrap// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-pdf/Aspose.PDF-for-.NET
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir_AsposePdf_DocumentConversion();

// Create Document object
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "PDFToTeX.pdf");

// Instantiate LaTex save option           
LaTeXSaveOptions saveOptions = new LaTeXSaveOptions();

// Specify the output directory
string pathToOutputDirectory = dataDir;

// Set the output directory path for save option object
saveOptions.OutDirectoryPath = pathToOutputDirectory;

// Save PDF file into LaTex format            
doc.Save(dataDir + "PDFToTeX_out.tex", saveOptions);
```
